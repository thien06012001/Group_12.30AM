            Our team performed a fantastic job of completing our duties on
            schedule. At first, some people wanted to develop a game foundation
            or community; however, after 1 or 2 discussions, we decided to make
            a business about healthy foods since all of us love cooking and
            eating healthy foods. Throughout the whole project, we had excellent
            communication and a terrific working relationship. Everyone received
            a task that was in line with their area of expertise in a fairly
            equitable work allocation. Everyone was always willing to assist
            other group members who were having trouble keeping up with their
            job or responsibilities. To ensure that every person on the team had
            a clear grasp of where each individual was at and what they were
            working with, we kept each other informed of the project's progress
            by detailing the specifics of the tasks each team member had
            performed. It is certain that there may be issues and mistakes made
            when building the website. We had a period of bickering and heated
            arguments about how the website function should be and how it should
            work. But not long after, we calmed down and sat together to explain
            everything and reflect on everything to figure out the best solution
            for moving forward. We shared many laughs and screamed at one other
            sometimes throughout our meetings, but we also respected any new
            insight and justification. Particularly, anytime one of the members
            exhibits signs of stress, we will stop working and then talk about
            the funny things and listen other's confidence. Because of the
            variety of our backgrounds, after working on this project together,
            we all gained new knowledge. We might not have the opportunity to
            work on a large project similar to this after this semester because
            one of our members will graduate and another will study abroad.
            However, the lessons we learnt from working on this project with
            these committed and helpful team members gave us the confidence to
            succeed in work in the future.

            Our team's workflow is significantly consistent, and my
            contributions of ideas, the uploading of photographs of our idea
            board, and the noting down of ambiguous information have made it
            easier for our teammates to grasp what we are doing. Since I am
            working as a Business Analyst, I need to prepare all requirements
            and analyze them. Then I need to sketch it and deliver it from a
            business perspective to IT one. Besides that, I also have a clear
            time plan for them to follow. I'm also in charge of getting in touch
            with the teacher if there are any questions. After this project, I
            was astonished at finding out some kind of coding languages such as
            HTML, Typescripts and restoring and customizing the data like
            Sanity, etc. Because of their high aspirations and dedication, our
            members don't give up when faced with challenges; moreover, we
            always encourage each other to try. Since everyone in our group
            comes from a different educational background, we transferred soft
            skills and hard talents and learnt about the distinctions. I'm
            grateful to Thien and Bang for supporting me a lot in terms of
            technology. With my knowledge of pitching techniques, report writing
            techniques and design UI for websites, I have been able to assist my
            teammate.

            As a main developer, I have to design a website based on the ideas
            of the group members and the sketch of the website which is designed
            by Hien. The working process of our group went very smoothly,
            everyone always tries their best to finish assigned work. Moreover,
            thanks to the clear time plan, team members can work a lot more
            efficiently than expected. One of the things that surprised me the
            most was the team members' idea to design a complete website and
            their determination to do so.Although the teacher only asked for a
            sketch of the concept of the website, the team members all decided
            to design the website with full functionality as expected when
            coming up with the idea. By trying to learn and learn about
            programming languages such as Html, Css, TypeScript, ... of the
            members, the website is gradually completed after a month. I feel
            very lucky to work with Hien because she has skills in report
            writing, designing a work plan for our team and connecting the team
            members together so we can do our best. From this project, I learned
            how to work as a team and write a report accurately with help from
            other team members.

            I am a front-end developer, so I need to work hard to be able to
            transform the design into a website and add functions into it. I met
            a lot of difficulties and I learnt how to cope with them through
            this project and our process is going very well, and I am so happy
            about that. Besides that, I still need to improve my technical
            skills as I recognized that I am not familiar with the programming
            language at all and a little bit about the design when making a
            website based on my ideas. After doing this project with my team, I
            appreciate the importance of teamwork and the deadline pressure.
            There was one thing that surprised me, that was our carelessness,
            when we were coding and Thien suddenly deleted all the things he had
            made, and after many hours and countless effort, we finally restored
            it. Via this mistake, I also learnt another habit that is always
            having a copy file or only clicking some button that I surely know
            what it is. This is an honour to work with them, my responsible
            teammates, I feel incredibly happy when doing this project and proud
            about our website.

            I learned about systematic collaboration while working with 12:30 am
            team. Consisting of members with strong individuality and opinions,
            we had a conflict at the beginning of the project, but we overcame
            it well and showed great teamwork afterwards. I am grateful to all
            the team members for their consideration of me as a foreigner. Most
            of the time, when I was a foreigner alone, I was bullied by the team
            and was given only what to do, but they tried to make me fit in. For
            efficient work, the writing team and the coding team were divided,
            but surprisingly, the teams did not split up and shared information
            with each other to share and study individual strengths. The coding
            team got advice from the writing team on the design and report, and
            the writing team learned information about HTML and CSS from the
            coding team. The interaction between each other made the team
            stronger. They taught me kindly, and when there were difficulties in
            solving problems, they tried to help to solve problems together with
            me. I am grateful that I learned a lot from them. In addition, the
            spirit of challenge was strong, so all the team members wanted to
            apply the best we could to the website, and as a result, we
            completed a functional website. Overall, I think the progress of the
            problem-free project added perfection to the results.
